title: Why I'm Building Fragments
date: 2025-11-09
excerpt: I'm vibe coding a simple blog from scratch to see what's possible, explore a world without platforms or intermediaries, and most importantly, create a place where I can think and write.

## I Like Writing
I've always enjoyed writing. It helps me think. I haven't had a good forum for it since university. I'll be using this space to document my vibe coding experience and capture my thoughts on design, technology, psychology, and anything else that strikes my fancy. 

## Less is More
Most blogging platforms are super bloated. The internet has gotten super bloated. I want to get back to a simpler internet, a right-click, view source kind of internet, a more homegrown internet. 

## Platform Politics
Why not Medium? Or Substack? Or, god forbid, LinkedIn? Those platforms have all the power. The future will be much less mediated. If the hype about AI is true, I should be able to create what I want, when I want, however I want. Within reason of course.

## Program Or Be Programmed
I read Douglas Rushkoff's book [Program or Be Programmed](https://rushkoff.com/books/program-or-be-programmed/) ages ago. It felt important then. It feels even more important now (looks like it was recently [updated](https://rushkoff.medium.com/program-or-be-programmed-1197ce31e4dc)). I don't want to simply sit on the sidelines, a passive consumer of whatever is given to me. I want to be an active participant.

## An Experiment
This is an experiment. I want to see what's possible, learn along the way, and inform how I think about my work, the world we live in, and what the future might look like. In less than 3 hours, I already have a super simple v0 running... wild.

## Join Me
I don't know exactly how this will turn out. I'm sure I'll hit plenty of roadblocks along the way (some day I'll recount the months long saga of transferring my domain). But that's kind of the point. I don't care about this being polished or perfect. I just want a place to create, however messy it might be.

If you've ever thought "I wish I could build that" but assumed you couldn't... follow along. The code is on GitHub. The process is documented here. The tools are all free or cheap.

You can do this too.

Let's build something.
