excerpt: "People love to complain about process while simultaneously not delivering great results"
---

Whenever someone complains about process, I like to remind them of the definition (I swear I'm fun at parties). Process is just "a series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular end". That's it. Nothing more. Nothing less. Repeatable steps to achieve a desired outcome. So when they complain, I ask if it's the desired outcome part they have a problem with or the repeatable steps?

It's always the steps. No one ever says they don't want to achieve their goal. What they don't want is someone dictating how to get there. The funny thing, it's almost always the the people or teams who can't deliver great results that complain about process. The best people and teams I've worked with realize repeatable processes allow them to offload a lot of the mundane thinking so they can focus their time, energy, and creativity on bigger problems while not forgetting the details. Most things we do to get from A to B aren't that exciting. They just need to be done.

I'm reminded of the research on the [power of checklists](https://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/). The best way to improve outcomes in a variety of complex domains? A simple checklist. The benefites? They reduce errors, help manage complexity, ensure consistency and reliability, improve coordination, and enable measurement. 

Sometimes process does get in the way or needs to be changed. The old way of doing things usually doesn't give way to  new outcomes. But most people, most of the time aren't doing something groundbreaking or revolutionary, they're just trying to deliver. So be open to changing process, but skeptical that it needs changing. 

To stay open-minded and avoid just shutting people down, I ask the process-frustrated person to propose something better. They eagerly volunteer. Then I give them all the requirements they need to make sure their new process can handle. A week later, we're all using the existing process and usually with a renewed sense of understanding why it's important.

My mantra: have just enough process to achieve the desired result and nothing more. Any more process is a waste. Process is important for consistent, high quality, repeatable outcomes. Keep it light. Be open to changing it. But put the burden of proof on those complaining about the current process.
