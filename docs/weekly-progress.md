# Weekly Progress Log

## Week 1: Foundations & Initial Setup

**Date:** November 9, 2025  
**Hours Spent:** ~4 hours

### ✅ Completed
- Set up Render hosting with custom domain (bryanrea.com)
- Configured DNS on Cloudflare
- Set up SSH keys for GitHub
- Created Flask application structure
- Installed dependencies (Flask, Markdown, python-frontmatter, gunicorn)
- Built base template with header/footer
- Created homepage and post templates
- Designed minimal CSS styling
- Wrote and published first post
- Tested locally - everything works!

### 🤖 What AI Did Well
- Literally could not have done this on my own, would have been months learning and trial and error
- It's a great partner and sounding board
- Generated simple, clean Flask app structure (I think... no idea if it's good or will scale)
- Created easy to understand, semantic HTML templates
- Produced readable, well-commented CSS
- Helped troubleshoot Git/SSH setup
- Explained concepts clearly (DNS, SSH keys, Flask routing)
- Pasting errors and asking what went wrong is a great way to fix something

### 🔧 Where AI Struggled / What I Had to Fix
- Hard to keep track of things switching between Claude, Gemini, and Cursor
- Wish I could connect Claude and Gemini context directly to a Cursor project
- Quickly builds things that are beyond my knowledge or capabilities, hard to verify if it's right
- Don't let AI write my blog posts, didn't capture my voice at all

### 💡 Key Learnings
- Flask makes flat-file blogs really simple
- Frontmatter + Markdown is a clean content workflow
- AI is excellent at boilerplate and structure
- SSH setup is one-time pain but worth it (public key encryption always feels like magic)
- Building in public creates natural accountability

### 📝 Notes for Next Week
- Add more posts to test the listing
- Consider adding a tagline or about section
- Start thinking about RSS feed structure
- Document AI prompts I used
